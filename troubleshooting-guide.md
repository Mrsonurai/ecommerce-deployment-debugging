# Troubleshooting Guide

## Overview

This guide provides troubleshooting steps for common issues encountered during the deployment and operation of the e-commerce application.

## Common Issues

### Frontend Accessibility

#### Symptom
The frontend service is not accessible externally.

#### Possible Causes and Solutions
- **Ingress Configuration**: Verify the Ingress resource is correctly configured with the frontend service's name and port.
- **DNS Propagation**: Check if the DNS settings for the domain are properly propagated.
- **Firewall Rules**: Ensure the network firewall rules allow traffic on the necessary ports.

### Intermittent Backend-Database Connectivity

#### Symptom
The backend services occasionally lose connection to the MongoDB cluster.

#### Possible Causes and Solutions
- **Network Policies**: Review the network policies to ensure they allow traffic between the backend services and MongoDB pods.
- **MongoDB Configuration**: Check MongoDB's logs for any errors and ensure it's configured to handle the expected load.
- **Resource Limits**: Inspect if the backend pods or MongoDB are hitting resource limits and adjust accordingly.

### Order Processing Delays

#### Symptom
Users report delays in order processing.

#### Possible Causes and Solutions
- **RabbitMQ Performance**: Analyze RabbitMQ metrics for any signs of overload or slow processing. Adjust the resources or optimize the message handling.
- **Backend Service Scaling**: Ensure the backend services are scaling appropriately in response to the load.
- **Network Latency**: Check for any network latency issues between RabbitMQ and the backend services.

## General Debugging Tips

- **Logging**: Use `kubectl logs` to inspect the logs of the affected pods.
- **Monitoring**: Leverage Prometheus and Grafana dashboards to monitor system performance and identify bottlenecks.
- **Exec into Pods**: Use `kubectl exec` to connect to a pod and inspect its runtime environment.
